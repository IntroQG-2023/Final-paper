    "\n",
    "The final task for the course is to write a formal scientific paper about the results of Exercises 6 and 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The report should not be longer than **2000-2500 words**, not including the code cells and references.\n",
    "- All instruction text (in italics) other than headings in the cells below can be deleted before you submit your final version\n",
    "- Please keep the main headings used in this document, but feel free to add code cells (or other Markdown cells) as needed to produce the plots you would like to include in your document.\n",
    "    - I suggest you copy your `introqg_functions.py` script from Exercise 7 to this repository. That way you can then insert code cells as needed to be able to call any functions you might want in order to produce plots and/or tables (DataFrames in pandas).\n",
    "        - Alternatively, you can also include images using the normal Markdown format.\n",
    "- **AI-LLM-OK** - Use of AI large language models, such as ChatGPT, is OK for this assignment. Details can be found below under the heading \"**Use of AI-LLM tools in this exercise**\".\n",
    "    - You can find a short introduction on how to use ChatGPT for programming in Python on the [Geo-Python course website](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/L4/use-of-ai.html).\n",
    "- **The final paper is due by 17:00 on 12.1.2024**\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Clearly acknowledge which tool(s) and versions of such tools were utilized to complete the exercise in a section of your notebook titled \"**Acknowledgements**\".\n",
    "2. Describe how the tool(s) was/were used to complete the exercise in a subsection of the Methods titled **Use of AI tools** with enough detail that your results could be reproduced. For example, this would include:\n",
    "    - Explaining how the tools have been used in general terms, such as descibing whether they have been used to generate draft text explaining what you have done for the exercise or to produce code you have used.\n",
    "    - Listing all prompts that were used to produce code for any sections where code has been generated using an AI tool. The code that was produced (only the final code is needed if multiple prompts were used) should be provided in the Appendix as either a code block or link.\n",
    "        - Please also note if the generated code was modified by you and how.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure to acknowledge or describe your use of AI tools in this assignment (if used) is considered cheating and will be handled accordingly. Also, please be aware that although an AI tool may have been used to produce parts of your exercise, you are responsible for the results that are produced."
